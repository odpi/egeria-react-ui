# Approaches to authoring semantic content  

## Glossary Author
This is an approach centered on authoring a glossary. Authoring start on around creating content within a particular glossary. 

## Subject Area
A Subject Area approach would start from the Subject Area and probably would not be interested in the glossaries. 

# Overall flow of the Glossary Author user interface

## Home page

The initial (home) page of the glossary author displays 3 tabs for Glossary, Terms and Categories. The tab shown by default is the Glossary tab. 

## Pages in the Glossary Author
There is a similar look to the Glossary , Category and Term pages, they all:
* default to showing a card view. A card shows the name of the artifact with an icon and a select box 
* this is a checkbox allowing the user to toggle to a list view , where an artifact can be selected.
* there is a search box at the top that filters the current content. 
* there is a paging widget at the bottom of the page, so the user can page through results.
* There is a + button to add a new artifact, the add it done within the current context:
    * when displaying under a child category, the new artifact will be created under that category.
    * at the top level, terms and cateogies can be created, a wizard is shown asking the user to choose under which glosssary they should be created.  
* when an artifcat is selected in the list or card view, new buttons appear. All artifacts have: 
    * a delete button - to delete the selected artifact         
    * an edit button - to edit the seleted artifact
    * a visualisation button - to display the selected artifact on a canvas and allow the user to explore its neighbour artifacts. This part of the UI is known as the GLOssary Visualisation and Explorer (Glove).
* Additional buttons appear for different artifacts
    * a quick terms button is present for glossaries, this allows the user to quickly add a number of glossary terms at the same time. 
    * a children button is present for glossary and category;  this shows the child terms and caterories

## Routing in the Glossary Author

The Glossary Author is has a number of react routes. If the code needs to load a new page then it updates the url and the react router then loads that page. In addition to the url location, there are query parameters on the url, these detail the state of the page. for example whether a checkbox is selected or not. This means that a utl can be pasted into the browser, and the page will render basedon the contents of the url. Bookmarking is therefore possible.

The react routes key off the last segment of the location, for example urls ending with /add will load the CreateNode component. In this way common components can be used for add edit, visualisation, and showing children without many routes entries. It also means that it is possible to navigate to a categories childrens children and still be able to have the expected add edit and visualisation capability.     

## Breadcrumbs in the Glossary Author

Breadcrumbs can be path based (basedon where a diplayed artifact live in the hierarchical structure) or location based (based on the users paths). The Glossary Author uses the lcoation based (users path).
The breadcrumb has a bread crumb item for each of the segments in the url. The url takes the form of repeating plural type followed by a guid, than an optional action as the last segment. a link is put on each of the breadcrumb items, for the plrual types this is the search screen under the parent guid of a particular child type. The link for a Guid is the edit screen for that guid.   


## Glove design

Glove uses a similar interaction pattern to the Repository Explorer. The key architectureal differences are:
1) Glove works with Subject Area Nodes and Relationships (not OMRS entities and relationships). So it works with concepts that the glossary author is 
familiar with.
2) Glove is started by pressing the visualisation button having selected a node from search results. The Glove UI will display this node as its initial state. 
3) Exploration of this selected node, shows a pre travesal screen with the number of each node or relationship - so the user can filter what should be displayed. When this is completed, the user is shown the additional nodes (kneon as a generation or gen) on the canvas. 
4) The additional nodes on the canvas can be explored producing new gens. It is possible to undo a gen and there is a history.
5) Undo undoes the last generation. 
6) Clear clears all the generation back to the first generation which contains the original node
7) Glove differs from the Repository Explorer in that it does not have a typeexplorer. The repository explorer creates displayable content in the view service including labels. For Glove, the information used to display artifacts is defined in the client side javascript. It is keyed off 2 files NodeTypes and RelationshipTypes. These files contain the shape of the nodes and relationship respectively, how to display them and the url to use when issuing rest calls for them.
